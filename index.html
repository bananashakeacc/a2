      <h2>Redefining Browsing for Humans</h2>
      <p>A² is transforming the internet from a passive information source into an intelligent, goal-oriented partner. The web is vast but fragmented: tabs multiply, search results scatter, and users spend hours filtering, aggregating, and verifying information. A² solves this by understanding user intent, synthesizing knowledge, and delivering actionable insights — all while preserving the individuality and creativity of content creators.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Collaborative Intelligence</h2>
      <p>A² is designed to work with humans. It provides real-time answers, extracts key facts, generates structured summaries, and adapts content to the user’s preferences. Complex ideas are simplified, multi-modal content — including text, images, videos, and documents — is interpreted seamlessly, and privacy is foundational: trackers are blocked, misinformation is flagged, and users retain full control over their data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Autonomous Research and Organization</h2>
      <p>Beyond assisting, A² can autonomously handle research and organization. Users define objectives, and the AI independently explores the web, curates insights, and organizes knowledge into persistent boards. It predicts relevant information, interacts safely with forms and automated agents, evaluates source credibility, and integrates across personal documents, emails, and cloud storage. Browsing becomes task completion rather than tab juggling, freeing users to focus on strategy, creativity, and decision-making.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Your Intelligent Internet Agent</h2>
      <p>A² is built to evolve into a fully autonomous internet agent. Within user-defined constraints, it executes tasks, coordinates specialized AI subagents to verify facts, analyze data, and negotiate opportunities. The browsing experience is personalized, bias-free, and immersive, with AR, VR, and voice interfaces enhancing interaction. Dynamic content adaptation ensures the web aligns with the user’s intent, delivering insights efficiently and intuitively.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>We aim to evolve the browser into an intelligent, autonomous partner that amplifies human capability. By combining advanced AI, predictive insight, and autonomous execution, A² transforms how knowledge is consumed, tasks are completed, and opportunities are pursued. The result is a web that works proactively for the user — faster, deeper, and more intelligently than ever before.</p>
      <p>This is not just browsing. This is <strong>Annapurna Square — reimagining the internet for humans</strong>, where technology amplifies human intelligence while preserving creativity, individuality, and the unique voice of content creators worldwide.</p>
